# Russia-2.0
A Complete Soviet Rework for Hearts of Iron IV

Updates are very frequent on our GitHub, however, you should **NOT** try to play with this current version unless it is marked as **_Stable_**.

Current version is : **_Stable_**.

## How to LOCALLY install the mod for beta testing :

- Download this Git as a zip file (Clone or Download > Download as ZIP),
- Start the HOI4 launcher and go to Mods > Mod Tools > Create a Mod,
- Name : Russia 2.0,
- Version : 1.0,
- Directory : mod/Russia 2.0,
- Tags : Alternative History, Events, Gameplay, Historical, National Focuses, Utilities, Military, Fixes, Balance,
- Create Mod. Do not enable it yet,
- Go to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod, here you should see a folder Russia 2.0 (if not then you've done something wrong),
- Go in the Russia 2.0 Folder and unzip the files there. All the files should be directly inside the folder (e.g. mod\Russia 2.0\common and NOT mod\Russia 2.0\Russia 2.0\common),
- Once this is done, simply enable the mod and you're good to go!

If you have any problems with the installation, feel free to ask (once you've completed the steps above).

## Extra notes :

If you encounter any bug or something unusual happens, you can add it here as an issue, or PM any of us directly on Steam or Discord. Using the Steam Page of the mod is also recommended but do **NOT** report any bugs from unstable versions, as those are meant to contain bugs anyways.

This mod has been developed for a few months now, and we are pretty happy with how far we got, however, feedback is really needed. So do not hesitate to tell your thoughts about the mod, the issues you encountered, or anything else you have in mind.

The mod is not achievement compatible. The 1939 start date now works fine.
The AI can play the Soviet Union, some factors have been added, as well as an ai_strategy and AI behaviors (2 paths are currently available). Future updates will aim in improving the AI.

Do **NOT** upload this mod as your own.

## What is to come?

- Democratic path
- Fascist path
- Non-aligned path
- AI Improvements
- Bug fixes
- Balance update
- Anything that goes through our mind
