# Russia-2.0
A Complete Soviet Rework for Hearts of Iron IV

How to LOCALLY install the mod for beta testing :

- Download this Git as a zip file (Clone or Download > Download as ZIP)
- Start the HOI4 launcher and go to Mods > Mod Tools > Create a Mod
- Name : Russia 2.0
- Version : 0.1
- Directory : mod/Russia 2.0
- Tags : Alternative History, Events, Gameplay, Historical, National Focuses, Utilities, Military, Fixes, Balance
- Create Mod. Do not enable it yet.
- Go to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod, here you should see a folder Russia 2.0 (if not then you've done something wrong)
- Go in the Russia 2.0 Folder and unzip the files there. All the files should be directly inside the folder (e.g. mod\Russia 2.0\common and NOT mod\Russia 2.0\Russia 2.0\common)
- Once this is done, simply enable the mod and you're good to go!

If you have any problems with the installation, feel free to ask (once you've completed the steps above).

Some things to note : The mod is NOT released yet, this is a beta testing version which might contain bugs, missing localization and whatnot. If you encounter any bug or something unusual happens, you can add it here as an issue, or PM any of us directly on Steam or Discord.

This mod has been developed for a few months now, and we are pretty happy with how far we got, however, feedback is really needed. So don't hesitate to tell ideas you might have, the issues you encounter or anything else you have in mind.

The mod is not Achievement Compatible. The 1939 start date now works.
The AI can play the Soviet Union, some factors have been added but it is not optimal yet.
