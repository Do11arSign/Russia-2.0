Updates are very frequent on our GitHub, however, you should **NOT** try to play with this current version unless it is marked as **_Stable_**.

Current version is : **_Stable_**.

## How to LOCALLY install the mod for beta testing :

**Important** : You **_cannot_** have two mods with the same name (new paradox launcher won't understand).

- Download this GitHub as a zip file (Clone or Download > Download as ZIP),
- Start the HOI4 launcher and go to Mods > Mod Tools > Create a Mod,
- Name : Russia 2.0,
- Version : 1.0,
- Directory : mod/Russia 2.0,
- Tags : Alternative History, Events, Gameplay, Historical, National Focuses, Utilities, Military, Fixes, Balance,
- Create the Mod. Do **NOT** enable it yet (very important),
- Go to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod, here you should see a folder Russia 2.0 (if not then you've done something wrong),
- Go in the Russia 2.0 Folder and unzip the files there. All the files should be directly inside the folder (e.g. mod\Russia 2.0\common and NOT mod\Russia 2.0\Russia 2.0\common),
- Once this is done, simply enable the mod and you're good to go!

If you have any problems with the installation, feel free to ask (once you've completed the steps above).

What if you already have the mod installed locally and want to update it with the latest version?
Simply download the ZIP file again, delete everything inside the Russia 2.0 folder and then drag the new files in.

## Extra notes :

If you encounter any bug or something unusual happens, you can add it here as an issue, or PM any of us directly on Steam or Discord. Using the Steam Page of the mod is also recommended but do **NOT** report any bugs from unstable versions, as those are meant to contain bugs anyways.

The mod is **NOT** compatible with Road to 56, overhaul mods, or mods that modify Soviet files! It might or might not work with Expert AI (please stop asking). The mod is NOT supposed to be 100% historical in any way.

This mod has been developed for months now, and we are happy with how far we got. We want to thank everyone who helped us, supported the mod, and everyone playing it. We could not have kept going without you guys.

The mod is **NOT** achievement compatible. The 1939 start date now works fine. The AI can play the Soviet Union, factors have been added, as well as an ai_strategy and AI behaviors (the AI can play any ideology).

Do **NOT** upload this mod as your own.
