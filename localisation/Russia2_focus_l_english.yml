Now the question is what should we do about them ? If they are not dealt with immediately they could oppose us in the fututr and thic could be a perfect oppurtunity to take our revenge on them after the humiliating defeat of the Soviet-Polish war of 1919 and the peace treaty of Riga of 1921."

 soviets.23.t:0 "The Permanent Revolution"
 soviets.23.d:0 "Although countless people have been executed and imprisoned as traitors and counterrevolutionaries over the past years, leading positions have been largely safe. They have not been exempt from suspicion, however. With the creation of the Fourth International, Stalin appears posessed by the thought that those closest to him were never truly on his side. Those who try to gain his trust have further fueled this idea to cast themselves in a better light.\n\nThe current situation is one of exceptional irony: the distrust within the current administration has rendered it unsustainable, and a coup is now imminent. Some party members are arguing that reinviting Trotsky and turning the purges on the Stalinists could minimize the damage of the civil war that will ensue. Can this plan, which has been the General Secretary's greatest fear for years, truly be executed?"
 soviets.23.a:0 "Unthinkable!"

 soviets.24.t:0 "The Fifth Column"
 soviets.24.d:0 "The persecution of enemies of the people, those who would reverse or subvert the revolution, has been ongoing policy since the Party came to power. The internal power struggles that followed have shifted our focus, and purging the Party ranks themselves has been given more emphasis since Trotsky's exile. Stalin has made himself an icon, but at the cost of making many real enemies and innumerable imaginary ones.\n\nHaving seen the worst of internal power struggles, the General Secretary is prone to act on the slightest suspicion. Being purged from the Party means imprisonment or death. Dark times lie ahead for those who show disloyalty - or just a bit too much loyalty to seem credible."
 soviets.24.a:0 "Are Zinoviev and his ilk still in touch with Trotsky?"
 soviets.25.t:0 "Trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center"
 soviets.25.d:0 "Despite Leon Trotsky being forced into exile, Joseph Stalin fears that he has secret supporters within the party. A series of rapid arrests and brutal interrogations have yielded confessions and testimonies conveniently pointing to some of Stalin's rivals. However, the more questions are asked and the deeper the secret police delves into letters and journals, the more people are implicated, if indirectly.\n\nParty members are beginning to believe that Stalin's absolute power and the death of his wife have isolated him to the point where he perceives anyone as a threat, but isn't that exactly what a traitor would say?"
 soviets.25.a:0 "Kalinin's wife is suspected. He cannot be trusted either."

 soviets.26.t:0 "Secret Trial of the Generals"
 soviets.26.d:0 "The Red Army has always been home to subversive elements, ever since Trotsky himself was Commissar of War. Documents acquired by the NKVD have implicated several high-ranking officers as not only traitors, but spies. Mikhail Tukhachevsky is among the most prominent of the suspects, and one Stalin is keen to rid the army of. Meanwhile, the navy's frequent contact with foreigners has led to many of them being arrested as well.\n\nAlthough there are documents from our enemies proving their guilt, there is no telling if they fabricated them, or if they were given false information by those who wanted this purge in motion to begin with."
 soviets.26.a:0 "Tukhachevsky must be tried in secret and executed immediately."
 soviets.26.b:0 "Rokossovsky refuses to confess, but cannot be allowed to live."

 soviets.27.d:0 "After several rounds of arrests and trials, the Great Purge has weaved a narrative that led up to this trial. Among the accused are not only old leaders like Nikolai Bukharin, but a number of diplomats, politicians, military officials and even many high-ranking NKVD officers. The charges are also more extensive than previously, including decade-old plots to murder Soviet leaders and sell the Union to its enemies.\n\nThe fact that the NKVD themselves are now among the targets of the purge has in a sense brought the proceedings in full circle. Threats and beatings have led to many confessing to all charges, even the most outlandish ones. The leading defendants face execution."
