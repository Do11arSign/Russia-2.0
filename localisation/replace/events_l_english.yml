#The goal of this is to rewrite every event that could possibly refer to SOV as "Soviet", Paradox apparently have no clue that Russia could go non-communist and refers to it as Soviet absolutely everywhere. This is a pain to do.

 news.103.t:0 "The Fall of [195.GetName]"
 news.103.d:0 "[195.GetName], birthplace of the Russian Revolution, has fallen to advancing German forces. \n\nSporadic fighting can still be heard from some suburbs, but a strange calm appears to have settled over the rest of the ruined city.\n\nEarlier today, columns of German soldiers marched past St. Isaac's Cathedral, whose great dome has been painted gray by [SOV.GetAdjective] engineers to avoid the attention of marauding Luftwaffe bombers. \nDespite their efforts, it is riddled with bullet holes and shrapnel impacts."
 news.103.c:0 "Someone will be shot for this!"
 news.104.t:0 "The Fall of Kiev"
 news.104.d:0 "Kiev, capital of [UKR.GetNameDef], has been captured by the advancing German armies in [SOV.GetNameDef]. \n\nThe capture of one of their most important cities is a serious blow to the [SOV.GetAdjective] war effort, but the question still remains whether the Germans can keep up their momentum. Moments after the Germans had occupied the city, thousands of mines planted by [SOV.GetAdjective] agents were apparently detonated in buildings along the Khreshchatyk main street, causing even more damage to the already ruined city.\n\nNow the invading forces look to the east."
 news.105.t:0 "The Fall of [217.GetName]"
 news.105.d:0 "Advancing German spearheads have seized [217.GetName].\n\nAfter fighting their way through the ruined [217.GetName] Tractor Factory and seizing the strategically vital Mamayev Kurgan heights, the Germans have forced the last [SOV.GetAdjective] defenders across the Volga to its eastern shore. According to unconfirmed reports, holdouts from the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army fighting together with partisans have retreated into sewers and basements to continue their struggle. \n\nNo significant organized resistance is believed to remain, however."
 news.106.t:0 "The Fall of [219.GetName]"
 news.106.d:0 "At dawn today, German panzers smashed through hastily erected barriers on the streets of [219.GetName] and half-tracks were seen unloading Panzergrenadiers on Red Square. \nThick, billowing smoke from the many fires raging in the suburbs could be seen rising into the air as German infantry stormed the Kremlin. Grenades and flamethrowers were reportedly needed to fight stubborn [SOV.GetAdjective] holdouts intent on defending every inch of the complex. The [SOV.GetAdjective] capital is now in German hands, but has been left a burning ruin. \n\nUnconfirmed reports indicate Lenin's embalmed corpse was safely evacuated east."
 news.106.a:0 "Is this the end of [SOV.GetNameDef]?"
 news.106.b:0 "At last, Moskau is ours!"
 news.106.c:0 "The Germans must be driven from [219.GetName]!"
 news.107.t:0 "The Fall of Sevastopol"
 news.107.d:0 "The heavily fortified city of Sevastopol, base of the [SOV.GetAdjective] Black Sea Fleet, has finally succumbed to German attacks. \n\nIts loss will severely hamper any [SOV.GetAdjective] attempt to contest the Black Sea, and the fall of the city is regarded as a significant German victory.\n\nAn edict has already been issued from Berlin, stating that the city shall henceforth be known as 'Theodorichshafen' after Theodoric the Great."
 news.108.t:0 "The Fall of Baku"
 news.108.d:0 "Earlier today, German forces successfully occupied the city of Baku, a vital strategic objective in their war against [SOV.GetNameDef]. \n\nLocated on the shores of the Caspian Sea, the city is the key to the Caucasus, and its many oil fields are sure to benefit the German war effort.\n\nIts capture puts Germany in a position to expand the war into the Middle East and possibly even India."
 news.215.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Formalises Anti-[SOV.GetAdjective] Pact"
 news.215.d_not_soviet:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has long condemned [SOV.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] in all forms, and has made diplomatic motions to demand other nations oppose it as well.\n\nNow, [GER.GetNameDef] has offered "states under immediate threat from [SOV.GetRulingIdeologyNoun]" a chance to form a pact against [SOV.GetNameDef]. Any country in the pact will be committed to fighting a war against [SOV.GetNameDef], should there come a time when a member is attacked."
 news.215.d_soviet:0 "[GER.GetLeader] has been a vocal opponent of [SOV.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] since before he came to power, and there has never been any doubt that [GER.GetNameDef] considers itself an enemy of [SOV.GetNameDef].\n\nToday, that attitude has been announced to the world, as the previously held "Anti-[SOV.GetAdjective] Agreement" between [GER.GetNameDef] and several other countries now has been formalised into a pact. The other members will be called to war should one of them end up in a conflict against us."
 news.215.a:0 "This is the only way to counter the [SOV.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] threat."
 news.215.b:0 "The struggle will only hasten the [SOV.GetAdjective]s."
 news.215.c:0 "Let them bleed each other dry."
 news.122.t:0 "The Fall of [408.GetName]"
 news.122.d:0 "[408.GetName], the largest city in the Russian Far East and home of the [SOV.GetAdjective] Pacific Fleet, has been stormed by Japanese troops. Its strategic position at the far end of the Trans-Siberian Railway makes its loss all the more detrimental to the [SOV.GetAdjective] war effort in Asia.\n\nMany of the city's inhabitants still remember the Japanese occupation that lasted for several years during the Russian Civil War. This time, some fear they may never leave."
 news.136.d:0 "After a series of pitched battles, Allied forces have occupied [219.GetName], capital of [SOV.GetNameDef]. The city has suffered extensive damage, and fires are still raging on both sides of the Moskva river. Despite heavy bombing the Kremlin is reasonably intact, and it has been chosen as the location for the headquarters of the Allied Occupation Administration.\n\nWith the loss of [219.GetName], the [SOV.GetAdjective] war effort has suffered an enormous blow. Although most of the government is believed to have evacuated the city well in advance of its fall, military experts claim that a complete [SOV.GetAdjective] collapse may not be far away."
 news.138.d:0 "Unlike 1920, there was no 'Miracle at the Vistula' when [SOV.GetAdjective] armies recently approached Warsaw. Polish resistance in the city has largely collapsed, and the [SOV.GetAdjective] flag can be seen raised over most government buildings.\n\nAre we witnessing the end of the Polish nation, or will their forces somehow manage to rebound and retake their capital? Most experts consider this scenario unlikely."
 news.138.b:0 "Onwards!"
 news.139.t:0 "The Liberation of Warsaw"
 news.139.d:0 "The devastated city of Warsaw has fallen to advancing [SOV.GetAdjective] armies, after the last German defenders retreated from its burning suburbs. Much of the city lies in ruins after previous battles, and local resistance members hurriedly emerged from the rubble to greet their liberators.\n\nWith Warsaw under [SOV.GetAdjective] control, the strategic situation for Germany in Eastern Europe may soon deteriorate further. Experts are doubtful that they will be able to mount a counterattack to retake the city, but the harried local population does not seem quite as convinced."
 news.139.a:0 "Is this the beginning of the end...?"
 news.140.d:0 "A [SOV.GetAdjective] communique has announced the capitulation of all German forces in Berlin. After encircling the city, the Russians stormed it from several different directions, with the German defenders resisting furiously every step of the way.\n\n[SOV.GetAdjective] troops finally fought their way across the Moltke Bridge and into the Reichstag building, fighting room by room until they reached the roof where the [SOV.GetAdjective] flag was raised over the city. The Battle of Berlin is over."
 news.140.a:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective] bear is growing..."
 news.140.b:0 "The Germans are no more!"
 news.141.d:0 "Rome, the 'Eternal City,' has fallen to the advancing [SOV.GetAdjective] spearheads. As Italian forces fell back, Russian troops fanned out into the city and dealt with the few remaining pockets of resistance. Most historical landmarks appear to have suffered little damage, although there are conflicting reports that the Pantheon was raked by machine gun fire.\n\nSo far [SOV.GetNameDef] appears to be respecting the neutrality of the Holy See, but their forces have positioned themselves in a ring around Vatican City - a gesture that must surely make His Holiness nervous."
 news.142.d:0 "The inexorable advance of the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army continues, and reports are now coming in that the French capital has fallen.\n\n[SOV.GetNameDefCap] announced to the Parisians that no arms would be done to any of them, shall they stay home and avoid disturbing the advancing [SOV.GetAdjective] forces against the few remaining troops of the Armée de Terre."
 news.143.d:0 "In the latest Order of the Day broadcast from Moscow, the capture of Paris from German forces was announced. Many of the city's defenders reportedly drowned in the Seine after a heavy [SOV.GetAdjective] artillery barrage demolished several of the bridges crossing the river.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was toppled after a massive explosion at its base, although it remains unclear which side was responsible. [SOV.GetAdjective] forces are now holding a victory parade on the Champs-Élysées while weary Parisians look on, wondering if they have only traded one occupier for another."
 news.143.a:0 "Is this the beginning of the end...?"
 news.144.d:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] continues its glorious advance, with [SOV.GetAdjective] forces recently having completed the capture of London. A parade was quickly organized by the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army, even before the last pockets of resistance in the city had been fully dealt with.\n\n[SOV.GetAdjective] sympathizers have been quick to turn in the names of known anti-[SOV.GetRulingIdeology] to the [SOV.GetAdjective] military authorities, and a People's Court has convened at Trafalgar Square to punish the worst offenders."
 news.145.d:0 "Fires continue to rage in central London, but it is believed that most of the city's German occupiers have either fallen in battle or been captured by the advancing [SOV.GetAdjective] forces. Crowds have emerged on the streets to cheer the Russians on as they move to deal with the last stubborn holdouts.\n\nCollaborators have been dealt with harshly, and [SOV.GetNameDef] have organized an interim council to administrate the liberated city until further notice."
 news.145.a:0 "A significant development."
 news.146.d:0 "[SOV.GetAdjective] forces have converged on Tokyo, and heavy fighting has been reported throughout the city. Most of the city is under [SOV.GetAdjective] control now, with the exception of the eastern suburbs where massive fires are still raging.\n\nWhen the fighting shifted towards the Imperial Palace, members of the Imperial Guard reportedly launched bayonet charges against the approaching [SOV.GetAdjective] troops. The palace was eventually stormed by a detachment of VDV paratroopers, who had to fight their way through the compound room by room. No prisoners were taken, but it is believed that the Emperor was safely evacuated before the city fell."
 news.147.d:0 "[195.GetName], the former capital of the Russian Empire, has been occupied by Finnish forces. With a population of over three million, the city has nearly as many inhabitants as all of Finland, but this fact has evidently not deterred the Finnish attackers.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the city should be integrated into Greater Finland, since Ingrian Finns make up a considerable minority in the regions outside the city. This, of course, assumes that the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army is unable to retake the city in a counteroffensive."
 news.153.t:0 "Germany Breaks Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 news.153.d:0 "The non-aggression pact between Germany and [SOV.GetNameDef], a surprising development to begin with, has now less surprisingly fallen apart. Germany has attacked, breaking the pact and returned to once again openly speaking of [SOV.GetNameDef] as a menace that must be faced for their visions of the future to become reality.\n\n[SOV.GetAdjective] leadership is less than pleased, but perhaps less shocked by the betrayal than disappointed that they didn't seize the opportunity first."
 news.153.a:0 "Trust between giants is a fragile thing."
 news.153.b:0 "We only signed it to bide some time for the attack."
 news.153.c:0 "A treaty is nothing but a piece of paper."
 news.154.t:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] Breaks Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 news.154.d:0 "The non-aggression pact between Germany and [SOV.GetNameDef], a surprising development to begin with, has now less surprisingly fallen apart. [SOV.GetNameDefCap] has attacked, breaking the pact and vowing to crush the German regime and once again put the expansionist state in their place.\n\nGerman leaders may have been planning an attack themselves, but the world will never know. They are now rapidly mobilizing to deal with the new threat."
 news.154.b:0 "They have no sense of honor or pride!"
 news.154.c:0 "The treaty has served its purpose."
 news.159.d_04:0 "Despite the recent [SOV.GetAdjective] focus on [SOV.GetRulingIdeologyNoun], the [SOV.GetRulingIdeology] roots of the movement transcend borders. This solidarity with workers around the world was a key element in [From.GetLeader]'s speech today when the [From.GetFactionName] was announced.\n\nGoing beyond a political International, this is an alliance that binds the countries militarily, with both regimes promising to aid each other against outside threats. Whether it will act as a sword or a shield for [SOV.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] remains to be seen."
 news.239.t:0 "[AST.GetNameDefCap] Joins the [SOV.GetFactionName]"
 news.239.d:0 "Seeing their countries as \"natural allies in the spread of [SOV.GetRulingIdeologyNoun]\", [AST.GetLeader] and [SOV.GetLeader] have signed a treaty that sees [AST.GetNameDef] accede as one of the primary members of the [SOV.GetFactionName].\n[AST.GetNameDef] has been declared a shining example of a worker's state, by and for the people, rather than the colonial overlords of Europe.\n\nWith the recent developments in [AST.GetAdjective] politics, some might say this move was inevitable. Nevertheless it is seen as a great cause for worry among those precise \"colonial overlords of Europe\"."
 news.239.a:0 "Highly disconcerting."
 news.239.b:0 "We welcome [AST.GetNameDef] with open arms!"
 news.239.c:0 "We are the very frontiers of justice and fairness!"
 news.239.e:0 "More rats boarding the ship we're about to sink."

 germany.11.t:0 "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 germany.11.d:0 "The German Foreign Ministry have proposed a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This treaty will greatly increase our mutual trade, and an additional secret protocol suggests the division of Eastern Europe into German and [SOV.GetAdjective] spheres.\n\nWhile the fascists in Berlin may not be trustworthy, this pact will allow us to deal with Finland, the Baltic States and Romania without fear of outside interference. The eastern territories of Poland will also befall us in the event of a Polish collapse."

 germany.12.d:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has wisely agreed to sign our non-aggression pact. This means that we are free to act without risk of [SOV.GetAdjective] intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, some of our friends now question Germany's commitment towards the ultimate destruction of [SOV.GetNameDef]. When matters with Poland and France have been settled, we may need to revisit this treaty, but that is a discussion for another time..."
 germany.12.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.13.t:0 "Moscow Rejects the Pact"
 germany.13.d:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has refused to sign our non-aggression pact! This complicates matters, since we cannot deal decisively with Poland or France without the risk of [SOV.GetNameDef] getting themselves involved."
 germany.13.a:0 "Curse them!"
 germany.14.t:0 "The Partitioning of Poland"
 germany.14.d:0 "Poland is ours, but the eastern parts fall under the [SOV.GetAdjective] sphere of influence according to the stipulations of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Should we withdraw our forces and let the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army occupy this territory? Failure to do so would render our treaty void."

 germany.83.d:0 "With the Anti-[SOV.GetFactionName] Pact, [From.GetNameDef] has secured fertile ground for diplomatic means of containing the [SOV.GetAdjective] menace. However, the pact does not constitute a military alliance, nor does it contain well-defined obligations for the signatories. [From.GetLeader] now seeks to extend the pact to an Anti-[SOV.GetAdjective] coalition, a binding agreement to join together in war if any signatory enters into a state of war with [SOV.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile substantially more dangerous, and likely to bring an end to any diplomacy we still maintain with the [SOV.GetAdjective]s, this is also our chance to ensure that we have strong allies on our side in the case of war."
